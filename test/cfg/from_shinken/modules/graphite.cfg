# Export host and service performance data to Graphite carbon process.
# Graphite is a time series database with a rich web service interface, viewed

   # Optionally specify a source identifier for the metric data sent to
   # Graphite. This can help differentiate data from multiple sources for the
   # same hosts. 
   #
   # Result is: 
   # host.GRAPHITE_DATA_SOURCE.service.metric
   # instead of: 
   # host.service.metric
   #
   # Note: You must set the same value in this module and in the 
   # Graphite UI moduleconfiguration.

   # default: the variable is unset

   # Optionnaly specify a latency management
   # If this parameter is enabled the metric time will be change to remove latency
   # For example if the check was scheduled at 0 but was done at 2,
   # the timestamp associated to the data will be 0
   # Basically this ignore small latency in order to have regular interval between data.
   # We skip an Graphite limitation that expect a specific timestamp range for data.
   #ignore_latency_limit 15
   
   # Optionnaly specify a service description for host check metrics
   #
   # Graphite stores host check metrics in the host directory whereas services
   # are stored in host.service directory. Host check metrics may be stored in their own 
   # directory if it is specified.
   #
   # default: __HOST__
   hostcheck           __HOST__
   
   # Optionnaly specify filtered metrics
   # Filtered metrics will not be sent to Carbon/Graphite
   #
   # Declare a filter parameter for each service to be filtered:
   # filter    service_description:metrics
   #
   # metrics is a comma separated list of the metrics to be filtered
   # default: no filtered metrics
   #filter           cpu:1m,5m
   #filter           mem:3z
   
   # Optionnaly specify extra metrics
   # warning, critical, min and max information for the metrics are not often necessary
   # in Graphite
   # You may specify which one are to be sent or not
   # Default is not to send anything else than the metric value
   #send_warning      False
   #send_critical     False
   #send_min          False
   #send_max          False
