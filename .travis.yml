# notice: the nose-cov is used because it is compatible with --processes, but produce a .coverage by process
# so we must combine them in the end
script:
  - cd test
  - pip freeze  # so to help eventual debug: know what exact versions are in use can be rather useful.

# specific call to launch coverage data into coveralls.io
#after_success:
  # to get coverage data with relative paths and not absolute we have to
  # execute coveralls from the base directory of the project,
  # so we need to move the .coverage file here :
#  mv test/.coverage . && coveralls --rcfile=test/.coveragerc -v
